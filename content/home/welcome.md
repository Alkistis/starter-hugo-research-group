Welcome to our **Research Group** website. We are working on cosmology with large-scale structure. We are excited about radio intensity mapping surveys with instruments like [MeerKAT](https://www.sarao.ac.za/science/meerkat/about-meerkat/) and the [SKA](https://www.skatelescope.org), as well as optical galaxy surveys like ESA's [Euclid satellite mission](https://www.euclid-ec.org). Explore our latest publications, our publicly available codes, and more!
