Welcome to my website! I am a cosmologist working on the large-scale structure of the Universe. I am excited about optical galaxy surveys like ESA's [Euclid satellite mission](https://www.euclid-ec.org) as well as radio intensity mapping surveys with instruments like [MeerKAT](https://www.sarao.ac.za/science/meerkat/about-meerkat/) and the [SKA](https://www.skatelescope.org) Observatory. Here you can see the latest news and publications by my research group, browse our publicly available codes, and more!
