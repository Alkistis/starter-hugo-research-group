Our group is committed to transparency and reproducibility in science. We try to make most of our developed code public and we also try to be as user friendly as possible by providing pedagogical Jupyter notebooks. 



Our public code is hosted on Github, please click the Project Site button below to visit our collection of repositories. These include:

* Multipole Expansion: a code for power spectrum analyses for neutral hydrogen intensity mapping experiments
* IM-Fish: a code for Fisher Matrix forecasts for neutral hydrogen intensity mapping experiments and their cross-correlation with optical galaxy surveys
* IM-Inflation: Fisher Matrix codes for cosmological and inflationary parameters using intensity mapping, galaxy, and CMB surveys.
* gpr4im: using Gaussian Process Regression as a foreground removal technique for single-dish 21cm intensity mapping.
