Pedro Carrilho and Chiara Moretti have led a paper on interacting dark energy from redshift-space galaxy clustering. We have performed a validation and mcmc forecast study for a non-standard (interacting) dark energy model[](https://t.co/ns7dnqPbZD?amp=1), focusing on the theoretical systematic of non-linearities when we interpret galaxy clustering measurements. We carefully compare the performance of the most popular perturbation theory approaches, that have been used for the analysis of e.g. BOSS data. Finally, we forecast unbiased constraints on the coupling parameter of the interacting dark energy model for surveys similar to Euclid and DESI. The paper has been posted on the arXiv.
