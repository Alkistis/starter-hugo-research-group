On 14 June 2023 the Scottish Affairs Committee launched the Science and Scotland inquiry. This inquiry is looking at the international influence of Scottish Science, and research and development as well as how effectively UK Government money is spent on research and development within the scientific community.

 As part of this inquiry, the Committee held a ‘showcase’ event in Edinburgh in early December 2023. During the event, some of Scotland’s leading scientists told the Committee about the ground-breaking research projects they and their organisations were doing.

I﻿ was very happy to represent the University of Edinburgh in the Physics panel, and talk about [ESA's Euclid satellite mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid).
