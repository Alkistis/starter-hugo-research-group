I﻿ still can't believe Euclid is finally launching this Saturday, July 1st 2023! I am going to be taking part in a special event at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Many of my colleagues and group members are going to be there, and it should be an unforgettable experience.
