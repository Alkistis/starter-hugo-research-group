We embed linear and nonlinear parametrisations of beyond standard cosmological physics in the halo model reaction framework, providing a model-independent prescription for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. As an application, we focus on Horndeski theories, using the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE) to parameterise linear and quasi-nonlinear perturbations. In the nonlinear regime we investigate both a nonlinear parameterised-post Friedmannian (nPPF) approach as well as a physically motivated and approximate phenomenological model based on the error function (Erf). We compare the parameterised approaches' predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum to the exact solutions, as well as state-of-the-art emulators, in an evolving dark energy scenario and two well studied modified gravity models, finding sub-percent agreement in the reaction using the Erf model at z≤1 and k≤5 h/Mpc. This suggests only an additional 3 free constants, above the background and linear theory parameters, are sufficient to model nonlinear, non-standard cosmology in the matter power spectrum at scales down to k≤3h /Mpc within 2% accuracy. We implement the parametrisations into ver.2.0 of the ReACT code.
