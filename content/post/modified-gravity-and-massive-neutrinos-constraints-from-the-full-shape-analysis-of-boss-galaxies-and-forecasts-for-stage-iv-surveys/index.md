Oï»¿ur new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09275) explains how we can constrain modified gravity and massive neutrinos with galaxy clustering data from surveys like [DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/). We focus on robust nonlinear modelling and prior effects. We also analyse BOSS data with our formalism.
