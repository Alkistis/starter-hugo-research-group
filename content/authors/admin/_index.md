Alkistis Pourtsidou is a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow. Her research interests include:

* Cosmology with 21cm intensity mapping: theory, simulations, and data analysis.
* Theory and observations of large-scale structure with Euclid, MeerKAT/SKA, and LSST.
* Modelling non-linear scales for galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing.
* Large scale structure tests of gravity and inflation.
* Interacting dark energy models.
